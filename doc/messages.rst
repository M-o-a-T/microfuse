==============
Message format
==============

Messages are packaged with Msgpack. All messages are dicts, common keys are
1-char strings for saving memory.

Authorisation and encryption are TODO.

Pre-Defined keys:

- a
  Action. Messages without this key are generally invalid.

- i
  ID / sequence number. Messages with an ID get a same-ID reply.
  Messages without an ID are not replied to. An ID of ``None`` is treated
  as if it had not been sent.

- d
  Some generic action-specific data: console text, return value, error string, â€¦
